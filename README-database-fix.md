# Database Fix: Cross-Device Data Persistence Update

A critical bug has been fixed in the SQLite database implementation that was causing data loss when accessing the app from multiple devices. This update ensures your data is properly preserved across all your devices.

## Issue

The database server was experiencing a reference error when saving data:
```
Error saving data to database: ReferenceError: settings is not defined
```

This was causing database writes to fail, leading to data loss when switching between devices.

## Fix Details

1. Fixed the variable reference issue in the `save-data` endpoint
2. Added improved error handling and transaction management
3. Enhanced logging for better troubleshooting
4. Added proper validation of the data before saving

## Deployment Instructions

### If using Docker:

1. Rebuild your Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. Check logs to verify the fix:
   ```bash
   docker logs calorie-chat
   ```
   
   You should see proper logs without errors:
   ```
   [2025-04-08T23:45:34.737Z] Data successfully saved to database. Stats: {"settings":1,"customFoods":3,"dailyEntries":2,"chatMessages":5}
   ```

### If running locally:

1. Pull the latest changes
2. Stop the current database server (Ctrl+C)
3. Start the updated database server:
   ```bash
   npm run db-server
   ```

## Verifying the Fix

1. Enter some data in the app from your primary device
2. Navigate to another device or browser and refresh the app
3. The data should now be correctly synchronized between devices

## Data Recovery

If you've lost data due to this issue, there are several options:

1. Check for backup JSON files in the data directory: `./data/calorieChat.json.bak.*`
2. Use the SQLite backup commands detailed in the main README
3. If you have a recent backup, restore it using:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 ./data/calorieChat.db < backup.sql
   ```

For more information about database management, please refer to the main README's SQLite Database Management Guide section.
